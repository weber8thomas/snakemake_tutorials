Building DAG of jobs...

Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

rule aggregate:
    input: data/raw.tsv
    output: data/B/5B.txt
    jobid: 10
    reason: Code has changed since last execution
    wildcards: sample=B, cell=5B
    resources: tmpdir=/tmp

Error in rule aggregate:
    jobid: 10
    output: data/B/5B.txt
    shell:
        
        head -n 1 data/raw.tsv > data/B/5B.txt
        grep -P '5B' data/raw.tsv >>
         data/B/5B.txt
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job aggregate since they might be corrupted:
data/B/5B.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
